_Figure 12: Generating the new module \(Admin side\)_

You're finally done \(or you think so\), so it's time to generate the module.

To make sure that you don't overwrite you code, the default is to write the files to /uploads/modulebuilder/repository folder. But if you're sure that you want to overwrite you current files, you can select the module to overwrite. This will save you some time, as you don't have to copy the files from the /uploads folder.
