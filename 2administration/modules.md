### Important information

#### Name

An example would be: My Simple Module

#### Directory Name

In case you write the module directory with uppercase characters, they are replaced automatically with lowercase, and if there are spaces they will also be automatically deleted.

#### Options

Here you can define general options for your module, e.g. where it should be visible (admin and/or user side), whether the module contains blocks, comments, and so on.

#### Image

you can select an existing image from upload directory or create a new one. For creation of new one you select an icon and modulebuilder creates a new logo with this icon and the module name.
