| Option | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Preferences | Here you can configure your preferences for the module |
| Update | Click here if you’ve made some changes to the module, uploaded new files, etc. – this will recompile the module and update all entries in the database |
| Blocks | When you click here, it will redirect you to the Blocks section of XOOPS, and select the blocks related to your module |
| Templates | Here you can modify the standard module templates using the XOOPS Template manager |
| Comments | This module does not support Comments so the link takes you the XOOPS Comment manager |
